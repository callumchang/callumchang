I'm Callum Chang and this is my GitHub page for now. I'm hoping to add some more projects here in the near future so hopefully this page will be more populated next time you look at it.
I have skills in Python, Java, C, C#, assembly, and computer hardware. I'm hoping to expand these skills and add new ones in the future.
